This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Introduction
Just building a component once and being able to configure it as needed, and also dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and can be even re-used as often as possible.

Using react router package to make the app behave to have multiple pages but in fact it's the magic of javascript and components that powers it.

Key topics learned when building the app:
How to output lists and conditional content
Styling of React components
A deep dive into the internals of React and advanced component features
How to access http content from within React app (AJAX) - axios package
Posting and fetching data from firebase database
Forms and form validation in React app
On the process of learning
Implementing Redux
